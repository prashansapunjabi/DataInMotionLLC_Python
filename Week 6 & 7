WEEK 6
## Problem: Create a function that returns True when num1 is equal to num2; otherwise return False.
# My approach: Here I have written a function that checks whether the 2 numbers provided are equal or not and prints the result accordingly.

def is_same_num(num1, num2):
    if num1 == num2:
        print(True)
    else:
        print(False)
is_same_num(4,2)


WEEK 7
## Problem: Create a function that takes a list of dictionaries and returns the sum of peopleâ€™s budgets.
# Here, I took the help of ChatGPT to write down the function. This was mainly because in my version of the code, I was trying to take in the list of dictionaries from the user manually, through the function itself. Another thing I learned from the AI-generated code is the function '.get()'. Anyhow, I found the code below really clean and easy to understand. Hope you find it useful too.

def sum_budgets(list_of_dictionaries):
    budget_sum = 0
    for person in list_of_dictionaries:
        budget = person.get('budget')
        if budget is not None:
            budget_sum += budget
    return budget_sum
people = [
    {'name': 'John', 'age': 30, 'budget': 1000},
    {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 25, 'budget': 1500},
    {'name': 'Bob', 'age': 35, 'budget': 2000},
    {'name': 'Eve', 'age': 28}
]
sum_budgets(people)

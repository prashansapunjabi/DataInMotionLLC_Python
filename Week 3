## Problem 1: Create a function that takes two arguments - the original price and the discount percentage as integers and returns the final price after the discount.
# My approach: Here I have returned the discounted price by first taking the original price and then subtracting the discount percentage from it.
def discountedprice():
    x = int(input("Enter product price: "))
    y = float(input("Enter discount percentage: "))
    z = (y/100)*x
    return x-z
discountedprice()

## Problem 2: Create a function that takes the age in years and returns the age in days.
# My aproach: This involves a simple return statement by multiplying with 365 in general as the problem demanded it. I understand that we are taking in just the age of the user and not their date of birth for this calculation.
def age_days():
    a = int(input("Enter age (years): "))
    return a*365
age_days()

## Problem 3: Create a function that takes an angle in radians and returns the corresponding angle in degrees rounded to one decimal place
# My approach: This task has been done using the math library from Python. It has a return statement using the function radians() to give the required output.
import math
def degrees_to_radians():
    degree = float(input("Enter angle(degrees): "))
    return math.radians(degree)
degrees_to_radians()

## Problem 4: Create a function, get_days, that takes two dates and returns the number of days between the first and second date
# My approach: Here I have used the amazing capabilities of the datetime library. I have never used datetime to a great extent before but this time I read up on it. I specifically used the strptime() function to convert the string inputs to dates and have provided the the date format. You can read more on the datetime library here: https://docs.python.org/2/library/datetime.html#strftime-and-strptime-behavior.
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
def get_days():
    date1 = input("Enter first date in YYYY,MM,DD: ")
    date1 = datetime.strptime(date1, "%Y-%m-%d")
    date2 = input("Enter second date in YYYY,MM,DD: ")
    date2 = datetime.strptime(date2, "%Y-%m-%d")
    new_date = date2 - date1
    return new_date.days
get_days()
